By using this source you agree that any work derived from it will be 
used for none profit (including donations) unless granted, and that
the derived work will fully support ModControlPanel intergration
for class features (charactersheet etc).
```

```
Mod allows players to select a class at level 5 for RP servers,
classes are limited to specific weapon/items, for example, only
the mage can use spell items, only the builder can use building 
items of tier 2 and higher, ranger is limited to bows etc etc,
all classes can build tier 1 building pieces and use stone tools/
weapons

Mod currently requires MagicSystem.pak to be installed to support 
the mage class (can be disabled).

This mod is considered unfinished/work in progress and may require 
some work to get working the way you want it to.

Aditional classes can be defined/setup in "Class/DT_Class_Data"

Current Classes
	Builder
	Fighter
	Ranger
	Mage
```
